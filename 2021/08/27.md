## Corrective Actions

Areas to focus on:

* **Prevention:** Understanding the cause and fixes go in this bucket.

* **Detection:** For P1 events that can be monitored and alerted on, how can we detect and alert within minutes so team knows about it ASAP?

* **Resolution:** Once we engaged on resolving, are there any improvements that we could make to reduce the resolution time?

The focus of the JIRA tickets should stay away from "hoping for the best" or "we'll do better next time" responses. They should follow the [S.M.A.R.T. criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) and be:

* **Specific:** Target a specific area for improvement.
* **Measurable:** Quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
* **Assignable:** Specify who will do it.
* **Realistic:** State what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
* **Time-related:** Specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

List of corrective actions:

* [x] No way to monitor for future failures
* [x] Consumers should report said issues on time!
